                <br><br>
                This original goal to simply be better at a video game was my introduction to technology, and a year later, I stumbled upon a Khan Academy course in web design. 
                <br><br>
                Since then, I've spent the following years learning web design and eventually fell in love with the more creative side of technology---especially how bold and empathetically accessible design can completely transform someone’s experiences with a website, app, or game.
                <br><br>
                Today, I’m a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, studying Information Science with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction Design, and minoring in Media & Journalism for interactive media. I plan on graduating in May 2027 to pursue a career in UI/UX design.
                <br><br>
                Outside of design, you’ll be able to find me watching (and analyzing) movies, playing guitar, listening to early 2010s music, gaming with friends, or going on a walk to quiet my mind.</p>
