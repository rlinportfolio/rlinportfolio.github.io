                <p class="normal-text" id="about-text">In 7th grade, one of my classmates asked me if I knew how to code. Despite having built my own desktop computer in 6th grade, I told him I barely knew what coding even was. 
                <br><br>
                Since that afternoon, I’ve spent 7 years learning web development and fell in love with the more creative side of technology---especially how bold and empathetically accessible design can completely transform someone’s experiences with a website or application.  
                <br><br>
                Today, I’m a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, studying Information Science with focuses in Human-Computer Interaction Design and Web Design, and minoring in Media & Journalism for interactive media. I plan on graduating in May 2027 to pursue a career in UI/UX design.
                <br><br>
                Outside of design, you’ll be able to find me watching (and analyzing) movies, playing guitar, listening to early 2010s music, gaming with friends, or going on a walk to quiet my mind.</p>
